# Local Development Environment

## Requirements

You need the following things installed on your machine:
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
* [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
* [terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
* [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
  * diff plugin `helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff`
  * git plugin `helm plugin install https://github.com/aslafy-z/helm-git`
* [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile#installation)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)

## minikube cluster

Install minikube https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

And start a local k8s cluster for the wbaas project.

**IMPORTANT: make sure you are NOT connect to the WMDE VPN when creating the minikube profile**.  
Note: 1.21.4 is suggested as this is the currently used production environments.

```sh
minikube --profile minikube-wbaas start --kubernetes-version=1.21.4
```

Once created, your kubectl context will automatically switch to `minikube-wbaas`.

If you want to throw the whole cluster away you can delete it:

```sh
minikube --profile minikube-wbaas delete
```

### Dashboard

minikube comes with a nice dashboard that you can turn on with a simple command.

```sh
minikube --profile minikube-wbaas dashboard
```

## terraform

Terraform is required to setup some needed dependencies.

To initialise terraform and apply the needed state do the following in `tf/env/local`:
```sh
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Terraform interacts with a k8s cluster, that you need to create beforehand!

For convenience, you can add local secrets to your cluster via a `terraform.tfvars` file in `tf/env/local` (it will get ignored by git). Use `terraform apply` to make the changes take effect.

Example for recaptcha keys:
```
recaptcha_v3_dev_site_key = "insert actual secret here"
recaptcha_v3_dev_secret   = "insert actual secret here"
recaptcha_v2_dev_site_key = "insert actual secret here"
recaptcha_v2_dev_secret   = "insert actual secret here"
```

Note: you will have to restart the ui pod (delete it with `kubectl delete pod [name of ui pod]` and wait for it to be recreated) for the recaptcha keys to be loaded.

## helmfile

You can see the changes that helmfile will make to your local k8s cluster by running the following command in the `k8s/helmfile` directory

```sh
helmfile --environment local diff --context 5 # shows the diff with 5 lines of context around changes
```

To actually make the changes use:

```sh
helmfile --environment local apply
```

In order to speed things up you can add `--skip-deps` after the `diff` or `apply` commands if you are not expecting to pull in changes.

**Note: This is a work in progress**

Once everything is running, you should be able to see the pods.

```sh
kubectl --context minikube-wbaas get pods -A
```

And connect to containers if needed, such as the redis master.

```sh
./bin/k8s-shell -e local -r redis -l role=master
```

### LoadBalancer

minikube does not provision LoadBalancer service IP addresses as part of normal operation.
It will only do this if you additionally run the `tunnel` command.
As a result if you provision a LoadBalancer services such as an ingress the `EXTERNAL-IP` will continue to say `<pending>` long after creation.


```sh
minikube --profile minikube-wbaas tunnel
```

Running the tunnel on linux might require you to forward the traffic to the cluster IP of the nginx-ingress-controller. This can be done by running the following command.

```sh
EXTERNAL_IP=$(minikube --profile minikube-wbaas kubectl -- -n kube-system get service nginx-ingress-controller -o template='{{.spec.clusterIP}}')
sudo socat tcp-listen:80,reuseaddr,fork tcp:"$EXTERNAL_IP":80
```

You should then be able to access the ingress (currently on port 80), and localhost services such as http://www.wbaas.localhost/.
Most modern browsers will automatically resolve *.localhost to 127.0.0.1.
If not, you'll need to edit your hosts file.

In order to skip out this LoadBalancer stuff you can get minikube to expose the ingress directly on a port.
But this will expose things on a different port and you may run into issues.

```sh
minikube --profile minikube-wbaas service -n kube-system nginx-ingress-default-backend
```

Note: There is more to making things work locally than this and we either need to setup dynamic DNS, or we need to be editing our hosts file!

## Mailhog / Local emails

For the local setup, [Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) is used to capture outbound emails.

You can view those emails by going to http://mailhog.wbaas.localhost/

### Using a locally built docker image in minikube
**Disclaimer**: Use [skaffold](https://github.com/wmde/wbaas-deploy/tree/main/skaffold) instead of this workflow if possible.

1. **Build the local image for minikube's docker daemon**

Run this in the directory that has the docker image you modified:
```sh
eval $(minikube -p minikube-wbaas docker-env) # use minikube docker daemon
docker build -t my-local-wbaas-service . # build the image
```

2. Modify the helm chart locally if there are any changes corresponding to the ones in the new image

3. **Set the helmfile values to point to the local image (and the local chart)**

You can now modify the helmfile values to use the local image. Note the change in `pullPolicy`, which has to be set to `Never` so that kubernetes doesn't look for it on the internet.

Using the UI as an example, this is what the local diff might look like:
```diff
 $ git diff k8s/helmfile/env/local/ui.values.yaml.gotmpl

diff --git a/k8s/helmfile/env/local/ui.values.yaml.gotmpl b/k8s/helmfile/env/local/ui.values.yaml.gotmpl

If you made changes to the corresponding helm chart, you also need to update the main helmfile to point to its location on your local file system.

```diff
 $ git diff k8s/helmfile/helmfile.yaml

Done! Run `helmfile diff` and `helmfile apply`.

## [Optional] setup bash completion
Here is how to get have tab completion working for common commands

Note: this was only tested on Ubuntu 20.04

```sh
# minikube
sudo sh -c 'minikube completion bash > /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/minikube'

# terraform
terraform -install-autocomplete

# kubectl
sudo sh -c 'kubectl completion bash > /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/kubectl'

# helm
sudo sh -c 'helm completion bash > /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/helm'

# helmfile
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roboll/helmfile/master/autocomplete/helmfile_bash_autocomplete -O /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/helmfile
```
