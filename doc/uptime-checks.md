# Uptime checks

Uptime checks are defined in terraform and runs against both the staging and production cluster.

These are using the [google_monitoring_uptime_check_config](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/monitoring_uptime_check_config) resource and requires a wiki to be manually setup with some content that the uptime checks are looking for.

## Setup example

For [staging](../tf/env/staging/uptime.tf), a developer has created a wiki like https://coffeebase.wikibase.dev on their own account and created a single item (Q1) with the english label `Arabica`. The uptime checks uses `GET` requests for validating that this and other expected responses is accessible through different endpoints and services.

The full list of checks are defined in the [variables.tf file of the uptime module](../tf/modules/uptime/variables.tf).

## Uptime check overview

To view the last state of all the uptime checks for every region, visit the [Uptime checks](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/uptime?project=wikibase-cloud) section in the cloud console.
## Viewing the metrics

These checks will be available as four different metrics under the  `monitoring.googleapis.com/uptime_check/` category.
